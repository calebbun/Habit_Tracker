# Habit_Tracker
A mobile application that allows users to track their habits and tasks along with how much time they spent on them. Users will be able to set a monthly goal on how many hours they plan on doing an activity; whether it be exercising, studying, etc. and will be able to track their progress through the app. By the end of the month, the app will analyze how much of their goal on each activity was accomplished and will produce graphs based on their performance. This application can be useful given the work from home and online learning set up. Others will be able to see how much time they spend on their tasks and will be able to make the necessary adjustments to suit their lifestyle or needs.
